# RedHatAI/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4 — LiveCodeBench (Harbor, 100-task sample)

| | |
|---|---|
| Task | `inspect_harbor/livecodebench` (100 tasks sampled from LiveCodeBench release_v6) |
| Category | agentic-and-coding (subclass: code-gen) |
| Exec tier | `agent` — Docker container per task, bash/python tools, hidden-test verifier |
| vLLM recipe | https://recipes.vllm.ai/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next |
| Task source | https://hub.harborframework.com/datasets/livecodebench/livecodebench |

**Protocol note.** The model card's "LiveCodeBench v6" (91.9 for Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next) is single-shot pass@1
over the full release_v6 set (1,055 problems). This task is a fixed 100-problem sample solved agentically (the
model can run public tests and iterate), so the two numbers are not comparable. One epoch (pass@1) instead of the
avg@3 of the other LiveCodeBench dirs of this repo, by request. Checkpoint: NVFP4 (W4A4) MoE experts,
compressed-tensors format (LLM Compressor), revision `863f54a`.

## Files

- `serve.sh` — deploys the model with a vLLM server. vLLM-serve arguments live here (parallelism, context length,
  KV-cache dtypes, reasoning/tool parsers, text-only mode), taken from the official recipe (Blackwell, features
  tool_calling, reasoning, text_only).
- `run_eval.sh` — runs the Inspect task against that server. Inspect-side params live here
  (task and dataset pin, epochs, sampling params, reasoning effort, per-turn max tokens, time limit, concurrency).
- `assets/harbor_registry.json` — Harbor registry entry with every task pinned to the fork commit carrying the
  dataset fixes (see Patches).
- `server_requirements.txt` / `client_requirements.txt` — `pip freeze` of the vLLM and Inspect
  venvs that produced the results below, with the host (GPUs, driver, CUDA, Python) in the header.
- `local_orchestrator.sh` — runs everything in your local dev environment: activates the venvs, sets GPUs
  (0-3, port 8000), one TP=4 replica (so each sample's prefix cache stays on one replica), the local
  checkpoint path and the Docker socket, starts `serve.sh` in the background, runs `run_eval.sh`, tears down.
  **This is the only file you should modify** to match the environment you run in.

## Run

### Setup (once per host)

Create a server and a client environment as below. The commands use the paths that `local_orchestrator.sh` activates;
if you keep the environments elsewhere, change the paths there. `server_requirements.txt` and
`client_requirements.txt` are the exact `pip freeze` of the environments that produced the results below (Python 3.12,
host details in their headers).

```bash
# server: the same vLLM nightly (0.30.1rc1.dev418+g50319916a) binaries plus the Qwen4Exp compressed-tensors
# PLE fix of vllm-project/vllm#59431, which merged after that nightly (see Patches for upstream)
uv venv ~/.venvs/vllm-nightly-ple-fix --python 3.12 && source ~/.venvs/vllm-nightly-ple-fix/bin/activate
uv pip install -r server_requirements.txt --index-strategy unsafe-best-match \
  --extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/50319916a3c72ec1358f9e29c7c282d316d86f78 \
  --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.git && cd vllm
git checkout 50319916a3c72ec1358f9e29c7c282d316d86f78   # the nightly commit the binaries come from
git show c32513b99d29b3c6efee38df752a696bc2696c2f | git apply   # vllm-project/vllm#59431; applies cleanly and gives the source tree that produced the results
uv pip install "cmake>=3.26.1" ninja "setuptools>=77.0.3,<81" "setuptools-scm>=8.0" "setuptools-rust>=1.9.0" wheel jinja2
VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED=1 VLLM_PRECOMPILED_WHEEL_COMMIT=50319916a3c72ec1358f9e29c7c282d316d86f78 \
  uv pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation -e .
# client: Inspect + inspect_harbor
uv venv ~/.venvs/inspect-harbor --python 3.12 && source ~/.venvs/inspect-harbor/bin/activate
uv pip install -r client_requirements.txt   # or: uv pip install "inspect-harbor==1.0.0" httpx2 && uv pip install "openai==3.14.0"
```

Docker with the compose plugin (v2.x or later) and buildx >= 0.17 is required. The results below were produced with
a rootless Docker 29 daemon (containerd image store on local NVMe, 512 network pools, runc with `NoNewKeyring`);
`local_orchestrator.sh` points `DOCKER_HOST` at its socket. Inspect builds a task's image before its first sample
if it is missing (serially, before any sample starts). If you pre-built the `hb__<hash>` images, pass
`--sandbox-prebuilt` to skip that step.

`local_orchestrator.sh` serves the checkpoint from a local copy (`MODEL_PATH`); unset it to let vLLM fetch
`RedHatAI/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4` from the Hugging Face Hub. Export `HF_TOKEN` in your shell before running
(never in the repo); the Harbor task files are fetched from GitHub at the pinned commit.

### Run the eval

```bash
./local_orchestrator.sh                  # add --sandbox-prebuilt if the task images are pre-built
inspect view --log-dir ./logs
```

Always smoke-test first: `./local_orchestrator.sh --limit 2`

## Results

With model generation config:

`temperature=1.0, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, reasoning_effort=xhigh, max_tokens=65536 (per turn), max_connections=100, max_sandboxes=100, time_limit=3600s, client_timeout=7200, TP=4 DP=1, epochs=1`

the following scores and token stats are obtained:

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| accuracy (pass@1, 1 epoch) | 0.950 |
| stderr | 0.022 |
| samples | 100 (100 tasks x 1 epoch) |
| time-limit hits (3600 s) | 0 |
| no solution submitted (scored 0) | 0 |
| turns truncated at max_tokens | 0 |
| sample errors | 0 |

| tokens / sample | input | output | reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| mean | 179,501 | 10,068 | 7,069 |
| median | 57,912 | 4,688 | 2,427 |
| max | 2,762,962 | 90,187 | 75,832 |

Input tokens are cumulative over agent turns (history is resent each turn). Agent turns per sample: median 8, mean
10, max 38. Wall time per sample: median 122 s, mean 178 s, max 1,207 s. Total run time about 20 min on 4x B200
(one TP=4 replica, 100 concurrent samples), with the other model's runs on the other four GPUs of the host at the
same time.

Failed tasks: 3308, abc397_d, arc188_c, arc192_b, arc195_c.

## Patches for upstream

Two fixes to the Harbor LiveCodeBench dataset are proposed upstream in
[harbor-framework/harbor-datasets](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor-datasets):
[#257](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor-datasets/pull/257) makes `tests/test.sh` write
`/logs/verifier/reward.txt` (reward 0) when the agent never created `/app/solution.py` (otherwise the sample
becomes an error and aborts the eval), and [#256](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor-datasets/pull/256)
moves the per-task `COPY` after `apt-get` in `environment/Dockerfile` so the 100 images share their apt layer.
Until they are merged, `run_eval.sh` loads the dataset through `inspect_harbor/harbor` from
`assets/harbor_registry.json`: the upstream `livecodebench@6.0` entry with every task pinned to commit `f7852012df`
of [eldarkurtic/harbor-datasets, branch
`livecodebench-eldar-fixes`](https://github.com/eldarkurtic/harbor-datasets/tree/livecodebench-eldar-fixes)
(upstream `main` plus both PRs).

vLLM (nightly and `main` as of 2026-09-30) cannot load this checkpoint:
`Qwen4ExpPLEEmbeddingMethod.from_quant_config` raises `NotImplementedError: Qwen4Exp PLE embedding does not support
quantization config CompressedTensorsConfig` for any compressed-tensors checkpoint, even when no config group
targets the n-gram table.
The fix (the table is loaded unquantized unless a compressed-tensors config group targets it) is
[vllm-project/vllm#59431](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/59431), merged upstream on 2026-09-30 as commit
`c32513b99d`, after the nightly used here. The results were produced with that same 8-line change applied on top of
nightly `50319916a3`, installed editable on the nightly's precompiled binaries. Setup reproduces that source tree by
applying the upstream commit to the nightly checkout. vLLM 0.32.0 and later releases include the fix (v0.31.0 was cut
before the merge and does not). Newer builds were not verified against this checkpoint here.
