# RedHatAI/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4 — SWE-bench Verified

| | |
|---|---|
| Task | `inspect_evals/swe_bench` (500 instances, `princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Verified` test split, revision `c104f840cc`) |
| Category | agentic-and-coding (subclass: swe-agent) |
| Exec tier | `agent` — one prebuilt Docker image per instance (official SWE-bench images, Docker Hub), no internet, test-based grading |
| vLLM recipe | https://recipes.vllm.ai/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next |
| Task source | https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_evals/tree/main/src/inspect_evals/swe_bench (eval version 5-C) |

**Protocol note.** The Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next card does not report SWE-bench Verified. `inspect_evals` solves each
instance with its default ReAct agent (`python`, `bash_session`, `text_editor`, `submit`; 210 s tool timeout) with
`--message-limit 200` and a `--time-limit 14400` guard, no internet (the task's default), graded by the official
`swebench` harness (FAIL_TO_PASS and PASS_TO_PASS must all pass). One epoch (pass@1). The sandbox images are the
official SWE-bench images (`-T image_name_template=swebench/sweb.eval.{arch}.{org}_1776_{repo}-{issue}:latest`)
instead of `inspect_evals`' default Epoch AI images, which keep every release tag of the project and so expose the
reference fix offline (see Patches). This differs from the other SWE-bench Verified dirs of this repo, which used
the Epoch AI images, so the numbers are not comparable. Checkpoint: NVFP4 (W4A4) MoE experts, compressed-tensors
format (LLM Compressor), revision `863f54a`.

## Files

- `serve.sh` — deploys the model with a vLLM server. vLLM-serve arguments live here (parallelism, context length,
  KV-cache dtypes, reasoning/tool parsers, text-only mode), taken from the official recipe (Blackwell, features
  tool_calling, reasoning, text_only).
- `run_eval.sh` — runs the Inspect task against that server. Inspect-side params live here
  (task and dataset pin, epochs, sampling params, reasoning effort, per-turn max tokens, time limit, concurrency).
- `server_requirements.txt` / `client_requirements.txt` — `pip freeze` of the vLLM and Inspect
  venvs that produced the results below, with the host (GPUs, driver, CUDA, Python) in the header.
- `local_orchestrator.sh` — runs everything in your local dev environment: activates the venvs, sets GPUs
  (0-3, port 8000), one TP=4 replica (so each sample's prefix cache stays on one replica), the local
  checkpoint path and the Docker socket, starts `serve.sh` in the background, runs `run_eval.sh`, tears down.
  **This is the only file you should modify** to match the environment you run in.

## Run

### Setup (once per host)

Create a server and a client environment as below. The commands use the paths that `local_orchestrator.sh` activates;
if you keep the environments elsewhere, change the paths there. `server_requirements.txt` and
`client_requirements.txt` are the exact `pip freeze` of the environments that produced the results below (Python 3.12,
host details in their headers).

```bash
# server: the same vLLM nightly (0.30.1rc1.dev418+g50319916a) binaries plus the Qwen4Exp compressed-tensors
# PLE fix of vllm-project/vllm#59431, which merged after that nightly (see Patches for upstream)
uv venv ~/.venvs/vllm-nightly-ple-fix --python 3.12 && source ~/.venvs/vllm-nightly-ple-fix/bin/activate
uv pip install -r server_requirements.txt --index-strategy unsafe-best-match \

```

Docker with the compose plugin (v2.x or later) is required. The results below were produced with a rootless Docker
29 daemon (containerd image store on local NVMe, 512 network pools, runc with `NoNewKeyring`);
`local_orchestrator.sh` points `DOCKER_HOST` at its socket. The 500 instance images (official SWE-bench images
`swebench/sweb.eval.x86_64.*`, about 5 GB each before layer sharing) are pulled, not built, from Docker Hub (100
anonymous pulls per hour per IP); pull them ahead of time at that rate, or through `mirror.gcr.io` after checking
that it serves the same manifest digest as Docker Hub.

`local_orchestrator.sh` serves the checkpoint from a local copy (`MODEL_PATH`); unset it to let vLLM fetch
`RedHatAI/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4` from the Hugging Face Hub. Export `HF_TOKEN` in your shell before running
(never in the repo); the dataset is downloaded from the Hugging Face Hub at the pinned revision.

### Run the eval

```bash
./local_orchestrator.sh
inspect view --log-dir ./logs
```

Always smoke-test first: `./local_orchestrator.sh --limit 2`

## Results

With model generation config:

`temperature=1.0, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, reasoning_effort=xhigh, max_tokens=65536 (per turn), max_connections=56, max_sandboxes=56, time_limit=14400s, message_limit=200, client_timeout=7200, TP=4 DP=1, epochs=1; 500 tasks in 5 runs of 62 / 64 / 65 / 91 / 218 tasks; errored samples retried once with `inspect eval-retry` (completed samples kept)`

the following scores and token stats are obtained:

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| resolved rate (pass@1, 1 epoch) | 0.794 (396 of 499 scored tasks) |
| stderr (binomial) | 0.0181 |
| resolved rate counting sample errors as failures | 0.792 (396 of 500) |
| samples | 500 tasks, 1 epoch, in 5 runs: 62 + 64 + 65 + 91 + 218 |
| time-limit hits (14400 s) | 0 |
| message-limit hits (200 messages) | 101 |
| turns truncated at max_tokens | 0 |
| tool calls that hit the tool timeout | 78 of 34983 (0.22%) |
| sample errors (excluded from the score) | 1 (scikit-learn__scikit-learn-14710) |

| tokens / sample | input | output | reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| mean | 2,681,311 | 34,619 | 24,533 |
| median | 2,131,186 | 29,763 | 20,586 |
| max | 8,881,735 | 139,604 | 94,794 |

Input tokens are cumulative over agent turns (history is resent each turn). Agent turns per sample: median 61, mean
64, max 99. Wall time per sample: median 1,951 s, mean 2,295 s, max 9,063 s. Summed run time about 12.4 h across
the runs on 4x B200 (one TP=4 replica, 56 concurrent samples), with the other model's runs on the other four GPUs
of the host at the same time.

Per repository (resolved / tasks): django 197/231, sympy 56/75, sphinx-doc 30/44, matplotlib 26/34, scikit-learn 27/31, astropy 17/22, pydata 18/22, pytest-dev 17/19, pylint-dev 5/10, psf 1/8, mwaskom 1/2, pallets 1/1.

## Patches for upstream

(1) Solution leak in the default images: `inspect_evals`' default Epoch AI images
(`ghcr.io/epoch-research/swe-bench.eval.x86_64.<id>`) keep every release tag of the project, up to 2024 releases,
reaching thousands of commits after the instance's base commit, plus 200-570 unreachable commit objects. The
reference fix is readable offline: in django__django-11099, `git show 3.0:django/contrib/auth/validators.py` shows
the fixed regex and `git log --all` finds the fix commit itself; in astropy__astropy-12907, `git show
v5.1:astropy/modeling/separable.py` shows the fixed line. The official SWE-bench images, built with the current
harness (remote removed, tags newer than the base commit deleted, reflog expired, `gc --prune`), are clean. Every
image used here was checked before its instance ran: no commit newer than the base commit reachable from any ref,
no unreachable commits. All refs are ancestors of `HEAD` except in the matplotlib images, which keep the release
tags of maintenance branches dated before the base commit (e.g. v3.6.1-v3.6.3 for a January 2023 base); the harness
deletes only tags newer than the base commit, and a fix merged to `main` after the base commit is not in them. The
official images carry one extra local commit on top of the base commit (a file-mode change by the image build);
grading resets test files to the base commit and is unaffected. Reported upstream as
[UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_evals#2632](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_evals/issues/2632): switch
`DEFAULT_IMAGE_TEMPLATE` to the official images, or ask Epoch AI to rebuild theirs with the current harness. (2)
`inspect_evals` declares `swebench>=3.0.15` but its scorer needs swebench < 5
(https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_evals/issues/2545); fixed on branch
`fix/swe-bench-cap-swebench-below-5` of https://github.com/neuralmagic/inspect_evals; the client venv pins swebench
4.1.0 (same scorer code). Host-side: the 34 matplotlib images contain files owned by UIDs beyond rootless Docker's
65,536 subordinate UIDs; they were loaded with those owners remapped to root, with layers rewritten from the
registry (the processes in the sandbox run as root).

vLLM (nightly and `main` as of 2026-09-30) cannot load this checkpoint:
`Qwen4ExpPLEEmbeddingMethod.from_quant_config` raises `NotImplementedError: Qwen4Exp PLE embedding does not support
quantization config CompressedTensorsConfig` for any compressed-tensors checkpoint, even when no config group
targets the n-gram table.
The fix (the table is loaded unquantized unless a compressed-tensors config group targets it) is
[vllm-project/vllm#59431](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/59431), merged upstream on 2026-09-30 as commit
`c32513b99d`, after the nightly used here. The results were produced with that same 8-line change applied on top of
nightly `50319916a3`, installed editable on the nightly's precompiled binaries. Setup reproduces that source tree by
applying the upstream commit to the nightly checkout. vLLM 0.32.0 and later releases include the fix (v0.31.0 was cut
before the merge and does not). Newer builds were not verified against this checkpoint here.
